    > ## **Question:** 
    Nowadays, films and computer games containing violence are popular. Some people think those films and games have negative effects on society and should be banned, while others think they are just harmless relaxation. Discuss both views and give your opinion.
    
    > ## **Answer:** 
    In contemporary society, the popularity of films and computer games that incorporate violent themes has been the subject of considerable debate. While some individuals argue that these media should be banned due to their potentially negative impact on society, others maintain that they are simply innocuous means of relaxation. In this essay, I will critically examine both perspectives before articulating my own stance on this contentious issue.

    On the one hand, there are those who fervently believe that films and computer games containing violent content should be prohibited. This view is predicated on the concern that such media can exert a deleterious influence, particularly among susceptible groups such as adolescents and individuals with criminal records. Critics point to a correlation between exposure to violent content and a propensity to replicate such behavior, resulting in criminal activities that contribute to broader societal malaise. The proponents of this argument assert that curtailing access to violent media would likely mitigate crime rates. I find myself largely in concord with this perspective, recognizing the potential risks posed by unbridled exposure to violence.
    
    On the other hand, some contend that violent films and computer games are merely benign avenues for relaxation, positing that they have no tangible effect on the behavior of the audience. Advocates of this view argue that media violence can, in fact, provide a therapeutic escape for many, serving as a channel for the release of pent-up emotions. However, I believe this argument fails to acknowledge that exposure to violence may not be universally calming but could potentially engender mental tension or anxiety for some viewers. The contention that a continuous engagement with violent content might lead to physical health problems further undermines the assertion that such media are entirely harmless. Thus, I cannot fully endorse this viewpoint.
    
    In conclusion, while the debate over the potential impact of violent films and computer games is multifaceted, I align myself more with those who advocate for some level of restriction or regulation. While recognizing that these media may serve as recreational outlets for some, the potential societal repercussions and individual psychological strains warrant cautious consideration. Balancing the need for creative expression with social responsibility might be the key to resolving this complex issue.
